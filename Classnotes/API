What is REST?
REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
It's a way to design APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allows different systems to communicate with each other over the internet.
APIs are like messengers that deliver requests to the provider (server) and then deliver the response back to the requester (client).


CRUD: create , read, update , delete.
